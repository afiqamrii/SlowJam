# ⏳ SlowJam
**Don't open until... later.**

SlowJam is a nostalgic web app that lets users create digital "time capsules" for their friends or partners. Pick a song from Spotify, write a secret message, and seal it. The receiver gets a link, but they can't see the content or hear the music until the countdown hits zero.

* **Time-Lock Logic:** Server-side validation ensures messages stay hidden until the specific date.
* **Anticipation UI:** A beautiful countdown timer for the receiver.
* **No-Account Needed:** Simple creation flow for maximum shareability.

### 🛠 Tech Stack

* **Backend:** Supabase (PostgreSQL)
* **API:** Spotify Web API
* **Animations:** Framer Motion
