Implemented Vercel Web Analytics for Next.js

## What was implemented

Successfully installed and configured Vercel Web Analytics for this Next.js App Router project.

## Changes made

### 1. Installed @vercel/analytics package
- Added @vercel/analytics@^1.6.1 to dependencies using npm
- Updated package.json and package-lock.json

### 2. Modified app/layout.tsx
- Imported Analytics component from '@vercel/analytics/next'
- Added <Analytics /> component inside the <body> tag, after the Toaster component
- Placement ensures analytics are properly tracked across all pages

## Implementation details

The project uses the Next.js App Router pattern with TypeScript. The Analytics component was added to the root layout file (app/layout.tsx) which is the standard location for app-wide components in App Router projects.

The Analytics component is placed at the end of the body tag, which:
- Doesn't interfere with existing components (Navbar, Footer, Toaster)
- Follows Vercel's recommended placement
- Ensures analytics tracking is initialized for all pages

## Verification

- ✅ Package successfully installed (@vercel/analytics@1.6.1)
- ✅ No linting errors introduced in app/layout.tsx
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful for the modified file
- ✅ Lock files properly updated

## Notes

The build command failed due to a pre-existing Supabase configuration issue (missing environment variables), which is unrelated to the Analytics changes. The linter confirmed that no new errors were introduced by our changes, and the modified layout.tsx file has no syntax or TypeScript errors.
