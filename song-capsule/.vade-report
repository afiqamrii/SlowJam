# Vercel Speed Insights Implementation Report

## Summary
Vercel Speed Insights was **already fully implemented** in this Next.js project. No changes were required.

## Current Configuration

### Package Installation
- ✅ Package `@vercel/speed-insights` version 1.3.1 is installed in dependencies
- ✅ Located in `package.json` at line 16

### Implementation Details
The project uses Next.js 16.1.6 with App Router, which is compatible with the recommended setup for Next.js 13.5+.

**File: app/layout.tsx**
- ✅ Import statement (line 26): `import { SpeedInsights } from '@vercel/speed-insights/next';`
- ✅ Component placement: `<SpeedInsights />` is correctly placed inside the `<body>` tag after all other components (line 44)
- ✅ Proper implementation following Next.js App Router best practices

### Verification Steps Performed
1. ✅ Dependencies installed successfully using npm
2. ✅ TypeScript compilation completed without errors related to Speed Insights
3. ✅ No linting errors related to Speed Insights configuration
4. ✅ Component is properly imported and rendered in the root layout

## Implementation Approach
The implementation follows the recommended approach for Next.js 13.5+ with App Router:
- Uses the correct import path: `@vercel/speed-insights/next`
- Places the component in the root layout file
- No additional configuration or props required for basic setup
- Component is placed alongside Analytics component for consistency

## Notes
- The project already had both Vercel Analytics and Speed Insights configured
- Build failed during page data collection due to missing Supabase environment variables (unrelated to Speed Insights)
- The Speed Insights component will automatically track Core Web Vitals and send data to Vercel
- No additional client-side configuration needed as the App Router automatically handles routing

## Conclusion
The requested Vercel Speed Insights implementation was already complete and correctly configured. No modifications were necessary.
